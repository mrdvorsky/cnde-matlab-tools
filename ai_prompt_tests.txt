Here are some example unit tests that I have written for a MATLAB library. Please write unit tests for the provided functions.

Use the following coding standards:
- When defining arrays, use commas.
- Use camelCase for variable names that are scalars or 1d vectors and functions, otherwise use PascalCase for multidimensional arrays.
- Prefer double quotes for strings.
- Always use the Arg=Val syntax for named input arguments to functions.
